#About VerifyThis 2017

VerifyThis 2017 is a program verification competition taking place as part of the European Joint Conferences on Theory 
and Practice of Software (ETAPS 2017) on April 22-23, 2017 in Uppsala, Sweden. It is the 6th event in the VerifyThis competition series.

The aims of the competition are:

- to bring together those interested in formal verification, and to provide an engaging, hands-on, and fun opportunity for discussion 
- to evaluate the usability of logic-based program verification tools in a controlled experiment that could be easily repeated by others. 

The competition will offer a number of challenges presented in natural language and pseudo code. 
Participants have to formalize the requirements, implement a solution, and formally verify the implementation for adherence to the specification. 

There are no restrictions on the programming language and verification technology used. The correctness properties posed in problems 
will have the input-output behavior of programs in focus. Solutions will be judged for correctness, completeness, and elegance.
