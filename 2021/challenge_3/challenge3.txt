4. We start an implementing of the shearsort algorithm in parallel in C using the message passing interface (MPI).
   The implementation is largely inspired by https://github.com/bjpeterdelacruz/hpc-benchmarks/blob/master/shearsort.c.
   The objective was to proof session fidelite and absence of deadlock using the Frama-C/MPI-V plugin.
   We have define the protocol and the constrains of the world size.
   Only a small part of the proof of session fidelite and absence of deadlock is done due to lack of time.
